		<h2>My Hobbies and Other Interests</h2>
			<p>
				I enjoy reading, and creative writing, I also like to play soccer. I started soccer because my best friend Elena plays and after I started I fell in love with it. I've only been playing for about 3 years, but I'm happiest on the soccer field. I mostly play left or right Midfield, or left Forward. I like the position of Midfield because that's where most of the action is so I'm not just sitting and watching from the back of the field.

			<p>Another one of the sports I've done is TaeKwonDo. I grew up doing TaeKwonDo, starting at age 4 I didn't know anything but I turned out to be really good at it. When I was 8 years old I got my 1st degree black belt, but I had to leave my studio when I moved from Sacramento to Long Beach. At my new TaeKwonDo studio I became an intern, helping the tiny tigers classes, which were filled with kids ranging ages 2-7. I loved interning at my TaeKwonDo studio because I have a passion for helping people. Whenever they needed extra help I would gladly volunteer, besides they were like family and there's nothing better than spending a little extra time with your family. Even though I ended up quitting when I was 11 I still won't forget the lessons I've learned and the friendships I've built because of TaeKwonDo.</p>
