		<h1>My Future</h1>
			<p>I'm going to Edison Highschool next year, and after I want to go to law school. I want to be a lawyer for kids in bad situations at home, to give them a voice. The inspiration for me choosing this job came from my mom. My mom is my hero and one of my biggest role models, so when she was a CASA volunteer when I was younger I was in awe. The kids she represented and spoke up for were always so happy around her because of all the good she did for them and that's what I want, I want to help kids and make them happy. I also want to live in a big city when I'm older like New York, and I want to travel to experience different cultures and lifestyles.</p>
