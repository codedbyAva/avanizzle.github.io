	<p> I have an English Bulldog named Porky, and my family and I absolutely adore him, but not every dog is so lucky. A shocking 70.1% of the cases of animal cruelty involve dogs, many dog owners stab, beat, or shoot their pets. There has also been cases of dogs getting set on fire. Not only is physical harm a problem, many animals suffer of neglect, not being fed, no water provided, no shelter or medical care, this can be just as dangerous and deadly as them being beaten. Hearing about dog abuse breaks my heart, the fact that anyone could harm another living being like that is unbelievable. What's worse is in some cases people witness or suspect this abuse but don't do anything. Please report dog abuseto local authorities, or donate to programs to help abused dogs recover, you could changea helpless animal's life.</p>
